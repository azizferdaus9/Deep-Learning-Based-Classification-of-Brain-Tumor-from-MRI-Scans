# Deep-Learning-Based-Classification-of-Brain-Tumor-from-MRI-Scans

This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to classify brain tumors from MRI scans, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in healthcare. Using a dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, the study employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze MRI images resized to 150x150 pixels. The model architecture includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers for classification into four categories: glioma, meningioma, non-tumor, and pituitary tumors.

**Key Features:**

**Model Performance:** Achieved a validation accuracy of 96% with the basic CNN architecture, demonstrating robust classification capabilities.
**Visualization Tools:** Utilized confusion matrices and visualized model predictions to interpret and communicate results effectively.

**Impact:** The project underscores the potential of AI in healthcare by enabling early and accurate detection of brain tumors, thereby supporting timely medical interventions and improving patient outcomes.
This project showcases the application of deep learning in medical image analysis, contributing to advancements in diagnostic technology and patient care in neurology.
